# ToDoList-With_MongoDB

This is a static website that is built on top of the simpler version of the same to-do list. In this project, Mongoose is used to work with the MongoDB local database and store reusable data.

EJS templates are used accordingly to create a User Experience that an extension could be added to the homepage(eg. localhost:3000/extension where extension is a user-defined name to create a new tab with a new to-do list). The newly created to-do list is stored as a new document in MongoDB and can be altered and updated.

App is deployed on heroku with MongoDB Atlas functionality added, and the url to the app is
